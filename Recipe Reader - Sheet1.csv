Perfect Pumkin Pie,"1 homemade pie crust or 9-inch deep-dish frozen pie crust shell (thawed), 15 oz can pure pumpkin (about 1 3/4 cups), 1 Large egg, 3 large eggs yolks, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar packed, 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves,1/8 teaspoon ground balck pepper, 1 1/4 cups evaporated milk","Blind Bake the Crust
For homemade crust: Roll out the dough and gently fit it into a (9-inch) deep-dish pie pan, ensuring it's snug against the pan's edges and bottom. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375°F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Remove the chilled pie crust from the refrigerator and place it on a baking sheet (this makes it easy to move in and out of the oven). Cover the crust with a piece of parchment paper and fill about three-quarters full with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 20 minutes. Take the crust out of the oven; remove the parchment paper and beans/pie weights and tent the edges with a few strips of foil folded in half lengthwise (this will protect the edges from getting too dark). Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is dry and lightly golden. Don't worry if the bottom puffs up; just press it down gently with a flat spatula, such as a pancake turner, taking care not to puncture it. Remove the foil but don't throw it away; you may need it again.
For frozen crust: Follow the instructions for blind-baking on the package.
After blind-baking the crust, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.
Make the Filling
In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin, egg, egg yolks, granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, and evaporated milk. Whisk until smooth, then pour the filling into the pre-baked crust.
Bake the pie for 50 to 60 minutes (at 325°F), until the filling is just set. It should look dry around the edges, but the center should jiggle just slightly if you nudge the pan. Keep a close eye on the pie as it bakes; if ever the crust looks like it's browning too quickly, tent the edges with foil strips. Let the pie cool on a rack (leave it on the baking sheet) to room temperature, a few hours. Slice or refrigerate until ready to serve.
Make Ahead: Pumpkin pie can be made one day ahead of time and refrigerated.
Freezer-Friendly Instructions: The dough can be made ahead, wrapped in plastic, and refrigerated for up to 2 days, or frozen for up to 1 month. If you freeze it, thaw it overnight in the refrigerator. The pie can be frozen after baking for up to 1 month. After it is completely cooled, double-wrap it securely with aluminum foil or plastic freezer wrap, or place it in heavy-duty freezer bag.

Whisk together the All-purpose flour, cake flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cornstarch and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
1 1/4 cup All-Purpose Flour,3/4 cup Cake Flour*,1 tsp. corn starch,1 tsp. ground cinnamon,1/2 tsp. baking powder,1/2 tsp. baking soda,1/2 tsp. salt
Place the cold, cubed butter into the bowl of a stand mixer and secure the paddle attachment. Turn the mixer on the lowest setting. I keep mine on “stir” the whole time.
1/2 cup cold, unsalted butter, cubed (8 Tbsp.)
Let the mixer cream the butter for 30 seconds, and then add in the brown sugar and mix 30 seconds, followed by the white sugar for 30 seconds or until light and fluffy.
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed (light or dark),1/4 cup white granulated sugar
Then add in the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract and blend until mixed. If any of the butter gets stuck on the paddle attachment use a rubber spatula to knock it off.
1 large egg,1 large egg yolk,1 tsp. vanilla extract
Keep the mixer on low speed, gradually add in the flour mixture. I add in about 1/4 cup at a time. Slowly and carefully add it in a little at a time until ingredients are incorporated.
Then add in the white chocolate chips and mix just until the chocolate chips are incorporated. Turn off the machine.
2 1/2 cups white chocolate chips*
Measure out ~6, 5.5 oz. cookies. I like to use a food scale for this but if you don’t have one, simply eye-ball it. Cookies will be a little smaller than a fist, huge I know! Keep the cookies nice and tall and don’t flatten them. Roll the dough in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Place cookies on a cookie sheet. You can use a silicone baking mat or parchment paper if you prefer.
2 Tbsp. white granulated sugar,1 tsp. ground cinnamon
Bake cookies for 10-11 minutes (see recipe notes if cookies are gooey). The secret is to pull them out before you think they are done. Let them rest on the cookie sheet for 15 minutes and then transfer them to a cooling rack. It’s hard to wait. Trust me, I’ve been there. Let the cookies cool on the cooling rack to finish cooling completely. Cameron likes to enjoy them 15 minutes out of the oven, and I like them best ~45 min-1 hour later. Enjoy with a big tall glass of milk!",https://krollskorner.com/recipes/desserts/best-snickerdoodle-cookie-recipe/
